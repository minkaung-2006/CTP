          <p class="p">
            Color therapy, also known as chromotherapy, is a form of therapy
            that uses color and light to treat certain mental and physical
            health conditions. We can trace this form of therapy back to the
            ancient Egyptians. They made use of sun-filled rooms with colored
            glasses fro therapeutic purposes.

          <p class="p">
            In color Therapy, different colors are thought to be able to treat
            various conditions. Color therapists believe that a lack of a
            particular color in your body might be responsible for your living
            condition. Here's a list of the most common colors used during color
            therapy and how we can use them.
          </p>

              Red: Red is used to energize or invigorate a person who might be
              feeling tired or down. However, red may also trigger people who
              might already be tense, which is why it's used carefully in color
              therapy.
            </li>

              or other sleeping disorders.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li style="background-color: green">
              Green: Green is the color of nature, and according to
              chromatherapists, it can help relieve stress and relax a person.
            </li>
            <br />
